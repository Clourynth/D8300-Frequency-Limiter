# Snapdragon 8Gen2 Frequency Limiter
Limits Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 CPU Frequency\
execute after 90sec upon boot (should be long enough for init)
- Little Cluster: 0.9024Ghz
- Big Cluster: 1.6512Ghz
- Prime Cluster: 1.7088Ghz

## Why you need this?
Use this you want to improve your Screen On Time by a margin.

When swapping apps, CPU frequency will boost to a very high level to maintain the smoothness.

This module lowers the CPU frequency to the target value after boot, reduces the peak power significantly when swapping apps.

You can also use apps like FKM or EX Manager to change frequency, but this is a magisk autoscript, so it will be much convenient.

## Requirements
Should be working on all Snapdragon 8Gen2 Devices
