Magisk/KSU Module

# Dimensity 8300 Frequency Limiter
Limits Dimensity 8300 CPU Frequency and set governor to schedutil\
execute after 90sec upon screen unlock (should be long enough for init)
- Little Cluster: 1.8Ghz
- Big Cluster: 1.6Ghz
- Prime Cluster: 1.8Ghz

## Why you need this?
### Use this you want to improve your Screen On Time by a margin.

- This module lowers the CPU frequency to the target value after boot, reduces the peak power and heat significantly when swapping apps or gaming.
- You can also use apps like FKM or EX Manager to change frequency, but this is a magisk autoscript, so it will be much convenient.

## Requirements
Should be working on all Dimensity 8300 Devices
